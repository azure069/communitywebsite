## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and want to ensure the safety of the **Nepali Community of Belleville** website. If you find a security vulnerability in our project, please follow the steps below to report it securely:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do Not Open Issues for Security Vulnerabilities**
Please **do not open an issue** in the repository for security-related problems. This is to prevent public exposure of the vulnerability.

### üìß **Reporting Process**
1. **Email Security Team**: Send a detailed email to [nepalicommunityofbelleville@gmail.com](mailto:nepalicommunityofbelleville@gmail.com) with the following information:

   - **Severity**: An estimate of the severity (e.g., high, medium, low).
   - **Impact**: A brief explanation of the potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - **Proof of Concept**: (Optional) If you have a proof of concept, please include it.

2. **Security Review**: Our security team will review the issue and assess the necessary actions. We will acknowledge receipt of your report and provide feedback on how we will address it.

3. **Fixes & Patches**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to release a fix as quickly as possible. You will be notified once the issue is resolved and patched.

4. **Public Disclosure**: After a fix is deployed, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability with details about the issue, the fix, and how to mitigate similar risks in the future.

### üîí **Secure Communication**
We highly recommend that you encrypt sensitive information using **PGP** or **GPG** when reporting security vulnerabilities. If needed, we can provide a public key for secure communication.
